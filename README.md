# Travel-Recomm-System-
This project builds a scalable travel and place recommendation system using the Yelp Academic Dataset. It applies content-based filtering with TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend similar businesses efficiently. The system handles large datasets, supports cold-start users, and lays the foundation for hybrid recommender models.
